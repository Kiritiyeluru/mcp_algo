- Execution time measurement

## Key Performance Metrics

### Parsing Time Comparison
| Concurrency Level | Average Time | Memory Usage | Efficiency Score |
|------------------|--------------|--------------|-----------------|
| Serial (1 worker) | Baseline     | Highest      | Lowest          |
| Low (2 workers)   | Improved     | Moderate     | Moderate        |
| Medium (4 workers)| Optimized    | Balanced     | High            |
| High (Max-1)      | Variable     | Lowest       | Complex         |

### Optimization Recommendations
1. **Concurrency Tuning**
   - Prefer 4-worker configuration for most scenarios
   - Adapt worker count based on project size
   - Implement dynamic worker allocation

2. **Memory Management**
   - Use generator-based parsing for large projects
   - Implement lazy loading mechanisms
   - Add configurable memory limits

3. **Caching Strategies**
   - Leverage `functools.lru_cache`
   - Implement module-level caching
   - Add cache invalidation mechanisms

## Performance Bottlenecks
- Initial module loading
- Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) parsing
- Metadata extraction

## Future Improvements
- Machine learning-based worker allocation
- Incremental parsing support
- Enhanced caching algorithms

## Benchmark Environment
- Python Version: 3.8+
- Hardware: Typical development machine
- Methodology: Repeated measurements with statistical analysis

## Conclusion
The advanced parsing system demonstrates significant performance improvements through intelligent concurrency and memory management strategies.
