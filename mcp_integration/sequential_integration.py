# Implementation Guide:
# 1. Thought Process Management
# - Capture sequential thinking steps
# - Store decision chains
# - Track reasoning process

# 2. Data Flow
# - Sequential Thinking -> Memory MCP
# - Thought process preservation
# - Context continuity

# 3. Integration Points
# - Decision tracking
# - Analysis storage
# - Pattern recognition
# - Context preservation

# Example Usage:
"""
# Sequential thinking operations
thought_process = sequential_mcp.analyze_problem(
    context="problem_context",
    steps=5,
    depth=3
)

# Store in Memory MCP
memory_mcp.store_context(
    key="sequential_analysis_123",
    data=thought_process,
    metadata={"type": "analysis", "source": "sequential"}
)

# Retrieve analysis
stored_analysis = memory_mcp.get_context("sequential_analysis_123")
